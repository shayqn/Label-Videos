    "Inputs for multilabeler, in rough order of importance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __root_dir__ : where all your recordings are. Each recording is assumed to have its own subdirectory, named after the animal_id\n",
    "* __animal_ids__: to indicate which recordings within the root directory you want labeled\n",
    "* __batch_size__ (default=500): maximum number of frames you want to view and label. Note that you are not allowed to save your labels until you've finished labeling a batch and closed the window.\n",
    "* __n_overlap_frames__ (default=50): number of overlapping labels for each batch. For instance, if frames 200-400 are already labeled and the user requests a batch of size 500 and overlap 50, they could be given frames 350-850 or frames 0-250, but never frames 0-200 or 400-900. It's recommended to keep a ratio of 1 overlap per 10 frames, so we can get a robust diagnosis of labeler-to-labeler agreement\n",
    "* __label_dict__: mapping of keys to labels. Provided here for easy reference. Do not adjust for this labeling session.\n",
    "* __labels_file__ (root_dir/master_labels.csv): where your labels will be saved. Highly recommend keeping it default, since it must be kept consistent for all labelers.\n",
    "* __min_gap__ (default=200): Smallest allowable gap between data. Let's say we have a 700 frame video and 300 frame batch_size with no overlap, for simplicity. With min_gap=200, videolabeler can give you frames 0-300, __300-500__ or 500-700. Must be smaller than batch_size. Highly recommend keeping above 200 for efficient labeling."
